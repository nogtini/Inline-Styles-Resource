#Inline Styles Resource

This is a resource to acquaint designers and developers with inline/dynamic styles. As the subject grows in scope, it is the hope that this resource proves to be a lively resource to help those who are looking to either begin the journey or grow their understanding.

Currently, subject matter surrounding inline styles is heavily dominated by [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), due to its component-based architecture, but expect the subject to evolve once other component-centered frameworks, such as Polymer and Angular 2, become widespread and Angular 2 exits developer preview.

*The resource's perspective is impartial, in that we wish to only facilitate access to the content available for those interested and not commentary upon its value as a technology.*
